## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There was some work to put together the layout in order to have a responsive website. I also liked the small slider with and without buttons, as well as the challenges of footers by changing the layout and active form.

### Continued development

The next step is to find a project  where to use React.js, may be bootstrap.
